0.5:
	* Included ternary C compiler (tunguska_3cc)
	* Added new instructions for 12 trit arithmetics: MLW, DVW, MDW, ADW

0.4.1:
	* Fixed broken instructions: CAD, XAY, XAX

0.4:
	* Added %INC directive
	* Floppy loading/unloading at runtime
	* Value caching added to tryte class
	* System time accessible from AGDP

0.0.3.2:
	* Fix of vector-mode bug.

0.0.3.1:
	* Fix of see-through background bug.

0.0.3:
	* Assembler now uses the C++ interfaces for bison/flex, and has gotten
	a more stylistically clear C++ code (as opposed to the old bastard
	C/C++ code); rules have also been made more lax, with regards to 
	variable/label naming, etc.
	* Value caching of nonary values as opposed to the old method of
	computing nonary constants runtime has paved way for an almost
	doubling of performance.
	* Raster graphics has gotten a new video mode, 3 color monochromous.
	* Interface is now largely drawn using a single, static image instead
	of colored rectangles
	* New instructions: CAD, XAM, XAX, XAY, XYX, PAUSE.
	* New device, AGDP (Auxiliary General Data Processor), does block
	operations and floating point arithmetics.
	* Indirect Y addressing had slipped by in the STUB stage without
	notice until now. It now works properly.

0.0.2:
	* Painting is done in a separate thread, which greatly
		boosts performance (especially for systems with multiple cores)
	* Reworked interrupt system (with queueing, instead of the old
		"chuck it over the shoulder" way of dealing with unwanted
		interrupts)
	* Assembler is nearly completetely rewritten to rely on flex and bison
		instead of the patchwork of code that was the old assembler. 
		The assembly syntax is also modified, to be hopefully 
		a lot clearer.
	* Rudimentary vector graphics!
	* Rudimentary raster graphics!
	* Fixes in too many previously defunct instructions to list.
	* Virtual floppy drive.
	* Mouse support.
	* Zlib compression of output.

0.0.1: Initial release.
