This directory contains a series of assembler source code files
that can be compiled into a memory image. To do so (after installing
tunguska), run

$ tg_assembler -o myimage.ternobj ram.asm

When it's done (it shouldn't take many seconds), you will find
a file myimage.ternobj has been created. To load it into Tunguska,
simply run

$ tunguska myimage.ternobj
