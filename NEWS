Version 0.5
* Added experimental compiler (3CC) for a ternary C-like language.
  o A memory image written for 3CC.
* Added instructions for swift and easy 12-trit arithmetics.
* Various minor bugfixes.

It should be noted that 3CC is not stable, or very pretty. It works
reasonably well, but it is significantly less stable than the rest
of tunguska.

Version 0.4.1
* Minor bugfix, fixing instructions CAD, XAX, XAY

Version 0.4
* (%INC)lude directive added to the assembler.
  o Memory image code now relies on this functionality,
    so it is important to remember that you only need to
    assemble ram.asm -- the rest is included automagically.
* Reworked floppy disk system, accessible from
  within the machine at runtime.
* Various speed enhancing fixes.

Version 0.0.3:
* Reworked, brighter interface.
* Auxiliary General Data Processor that allows for
  block operations and floating point arithmetics.
* More lenient assembler, allows uppercase labels 
  and variables.
* Several new operations:
 o XAM  -  eXchange Accumulator value with Memory value
 o XAX  -  eXchange Accumulator value with X value
 o XAY  -  eXchange Accumulator value with Y value
 o XYX  -  eXchange Y value with X value
 o CAD  -  Compare ADdress (X:Y vs. argument)
 o PAUSE - Pseudo instruction, triggers pause of Tunguska
	    (useful in debugging)
* Performance boost on a damn near epic scale. It should
  be somewhere in the neighborhood of twice as fast as 0.0.2!
* Less GNU-dependent code. Should be easier to port to other
  systems.
* Indirect-Y addressing was broken, it isn't any more.

Version 0.0.2:

* New and improved interrupt system.
* New raster and vector based graphics modes.
* Mouse support.
* A completely rewritten assembler based on yacc/flex.
 o Assembler syntax has been extensively modified to provide
   clearer assembly code.
 o Inline arithmetics. 
 o Assembler variables.
* Zlib compression of memory images.

Version 0.0.1: 

* Initial release.
